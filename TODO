eslint for using ordering

SHOULD HAVE:
* empty texts on series/movies without hits for the filters.
NICE TO HAVE
* if you lose focus becuz of a refresh, select the first element again?
  * when you lose focus (series jumps away from unseen to watched), select first element, so space to continue works.
